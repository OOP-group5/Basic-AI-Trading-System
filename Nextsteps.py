#improvements in different files:

#**alpha.py: GaussianNaiveBayesAlphaModel**

#1. Implement feature scaling: Normalize the features before training the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. This can be done using the `StandardScaler` from the scikit-learn library.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Inside the train() method
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features.iloc[:-2])
symbol_data.model = GaussianNB().fit(scaled_features, labels_by_symbol[symbol])
```

#2. Add a confidence threshold: Set a minimum confidence level for the classifier's predictions to generate insights. Only consider predictions with a probability above the threshold.

# Inside the Update() method
threshold = 0.6  # Adjust the threshold value as desired

# ...

for symbol, symbol_data in tradable_symbols.items():
    direction = symbol_data.model.predict(features)
    probability = symbol_data.model.predict_proba(features)
    if direction and probability > threshold:
        insights.append(Insight.Price(symbol, data.Time + timedelta(days=1, seconds=-1), 
                                      direction, None, None, None, weight))

#Inside the `GaussianNaiveBayesAlphaModel` class in the `alpha.py` file, locate the `train` method. Add the following code snippet to perform feature scaling before training the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier:


from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler


def train(self):
    """
    Trains the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier model.
    """
    features = pd.DataFrame()
    labels_by_symbol = {}

    for symbol, symbol_data in self.symbol_data_by_symbol.items():
        if symbol_data.IsReady:
            features = pd.concat([features, symbol_data.features_by_day], axis=1)
            labels_by_symbol[symbol] = symbol_data.labels_by_day

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features.iloc[:-2])

    for symbol, symbol_data in self.symbol_data_by_symbol.items():
        if symbol_data.IsReady:
            symbol_data.model = GaussianNB().fit(scaled_features, labels_by_symbol[symbol])


#This code snippet imports the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn, creates an instance of `StandardScaler`, and applies feature scaling using the `fit_transform` method. The scaled features are then used to train the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier model.
#By applying feature scaling, the algorithm can handle features with different scales and improve the classifier's performance. This replace the existing `train` method in `alpha.py` file with the updated code.
#However, due to the limited time spent on this part, the algorithm's performance in terms of investment results was suboptimal. It resulted in a significant loss of approximately 80% of the initial capital. 

#**main.py: GaussianNaiveBayesClassificationAlgorithm**

#1. Implement OnData method: Add logic inside the `OnData` method to handle incoming data events. This is where you can execute trading decisions based on the generated insights.


def OnData(self, data):
    for insight in data.GetAlpha(self.alphaModel):
        if insight.Direction == InsightDirection.Up:
            self.SetHoldings(insight.Symbol, 0.5)
        elif insight.Direction == InsightDirection.Down:
            self.Liquidate(insight.Symbol)


#2. Implement OnOrderEvent method: Add logic inside the `OnOrderEvent` method to handle events related to order executions, cancellations, or rejections.

def OnOrderEvent(self, orderEvent):
    self.Debug(f"Order event: {orderEvent}")
    # Add custom logic here based on the order event
