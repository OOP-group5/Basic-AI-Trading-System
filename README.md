# Basic-AI-Trading-System

1. Introduction
The aim of this project was to develop a basic AI trading system using Gaussian Naive Bayes classification. The project explores the application of AI techniques in the financial markets to make informed trading decisions. This report provides an overview of the project, outlines the contributions of the sole team member, discusses the AI technique employed (Gaussian Naive Bayes), and highlights the significance of the work in the field of AI-related applications in finance.

2. Methodology
The project followed a systematic approach consisting of the following key components:
- Data Collection: Historical market data, including price movements, volume, and technical indicators, was collected for a selected universe of stocks.
- Baseline Strategy: A rule-based baseline strategy was implemented as a starting point to evaluate the performance of the system using historical data.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification: The Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm was employed to develop the AI trading system. The model utilizes the assumption of feature independence and calculates the conditional probabilities of each feature given a particular class to make predictions on trading decisions.
- Evaluation and Error Analysis: An error analysis process was initiated to identify and analyze different types of errors made by the model. The aim was to investigate any patterns in misclassifications and understand the factors contributing to these errors.

3. Contributions
This project was undertaken solely by the author of this report, who performed all aspects of the project, including data collection (from the platform), implementation of the baseline strategy, development of the Gaussian Naive Bayes model, and the evaluation and error analysis process.

4. AI Technique: Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification
The project utilized the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm as the AI technique for the trading system. Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm that assumes the features are normally distributed and independent of each other. It calculates the conditional probabilities of each feature given a particular class and uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for class prediction.

Gaussian Naive Bayes offers several advantages that make it suitable for this application. It is computationally efficient and can handle a large number of features. It also handles continuous data well, making it suitable for financial market data analysis. Additionally, Gaussian Naive Bayes provides interpretability, allowing traders to understand the factors influencing the model's decision-making process.

5. Preliminary experiments: 
The algorithm uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classification model for generating trading insights based on the daily price data of big tech stocks. The main components of the project are:
• Universe Selection Model: The BigTechUniverseSelectionModel is responsible for selecting the universe of securities to be traded. It filters out stocks that do not meet certain criteria (e.g., market capitalization, sector) and returns the remaining securities.

• Alpha Model: The GaussianNaiveBayesAlphaModel is an alpha model that uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the direction of stock prices. It trains the classifier using historical price and label data, and then generates trading insights based on the classifier's predictions.

• Portfolio Construction Model: The InsightWeightingPortfolioConstructionModel is responsible for constructing the portfolio based on the trading insights generated by the alpha model. It assigns weights to each insight based on their confidence levels and adjusts the portfolio holdings accordingly.

• Risk Management Model: The NullRiskManagementModel is a risk management model that does not apply any risk management techniques. It simply allows the algorithm to execute the trades without any additional risk management constraints.

In terms of what I did similarly, I provided a code implementation for the alpha model (GaussianNaiveBayesAlphaModel) based on the provided description. The alpha model trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using historical price and label data and generates trading insights based on the classifier's predictions.

In terms of what I did differently, I did not provide implementations for the other components of the project, such as the universe selection model, portfolio construction model, and risk management model. These components are essential for the algorithm's functionality, but since they were not explicitly mentioned in the project description, I focused on providing an implementation for the alpha model.

Additionally, I provided a basic template for the main algorithm (GaussianNaiveBayesClassificationAlgorithm) that initializes the algorithm, sets the start and end dates, cash, and configures the universe selection, alpha model, portfolio construction, and risk management. However, the OnData and OnOrderEvent methods are left empty as they were not specified in the project description. Overall, the code I provided is a partial implementation that focuses on the alpha model using Gaussian Naive Bayes classification. 

6. Results and Evaluation
The evaluation of the trading system is currently ongoing, and formal evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score are yet to be implemented. The project has conducted preliminary experiments on the QuantConnect platform to assess the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes model using historical datasets. An error analysis process has been initiated to identify and analyze different types of errors made by the model.
The next steps include further refining the Gaussian Naive Bayes model by exploring feature engineering techniques to improve its predictive power. Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize the model's performance. Cross-validation techniques will be implemented to obtain a more robust assessment of the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, risk management strategies will be incorporated into the trading system to effectively manage risk and protect against potential losses. Extensive backtesting and simulation will be conducted using historical data to validate the system's performance over different market conditions and evaluate its potential profitability.
