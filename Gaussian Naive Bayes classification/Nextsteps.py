#**alpha.py: GaussianNaiveBayesAlphaModel**

#1. Implement feature scaling: Normalize the features before training the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. This can be done using the `StandardScaler` from the scikit-learn library.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Inside the train() method
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features.iloc[:-2])
symbol_data.model = GaussianNB().fit(scaled_features, labels_by_symbol[symbol])
```

#2. Add a confidence threshold: Set a minimum confidence level for the classifier's predictions to generate insights. Only consider predictions with a probability above the threshold.

# Inside the Update() method
threshold = 0.6  # Adjust the threshold value as desired

# ...

for symbol, symbol_data in tradable_symbols.items():
    direction = symbol_data.model.predict(features)
    probability = symbol_data.model.predict_proba(features)
    if direction and probability > threshold:
        insights.append(Insight.Price(symbol, data.Time + timedelta(days=1, seconds=-1), 
                                      direction, None, None, None, weight))
#However, due to the limited time working on this, the algorithm provide a bad result of investment when lost around 80% of the initial captital

#**main.py: GaussianNaiveBayesClassificationAlgorithm**

#1. Implement OnData method: Add logic inside the `OnData` method to handle incoming data events. This is where you can execute trading decisions based on the generated insights.


def OnData(self, data):
    for insight in data.GetAlpha(self.alphaModel):
        if insight.Direction == InsightDirection.Up:
            self.SetHoldings(insight.Symbol, 0.5)
        elif insight.Direction == InsightDirection.Down:
            self.Liquidate(insight.Symbol)


#2. Implement OnOrderEvent method: Add logic inside the `OnOrderEvent` method to handle events related to order executions, cancellations, or rejections.

def OnOrderEvent(self, orderEvent):
    self.Debug(f"Order event: {orderEvent}")
    # Add custom logic here based on the order event
